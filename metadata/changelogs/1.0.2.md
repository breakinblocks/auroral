# Auroral 1.0.2

## New Features

- Glow Leeks can now be used as an alternate brewing ingredient for Night Vision potions
  - Awkward Potion + Glow Leek → Night Vision Potion

### Auroral Nautilus Behavior Improvements

- Wild Auroral Nautili are now attracted to players holding Aurora Shards
  - They will slowly drift toward nearby players holding shards, making taming easier
- Tamed Auroral Nautili now slowly orbit around their owner
  - Orbit radius of ~3 blocks at ~2 blocks above the owner's head
- Added "stay" command for tamed nautili (like wolves)
  - Shift + Right-click to toggle between following and staying
  - When staying, the nautilus hovers in place
  - When following, it resumes orbiting around the owner
- Nautili can only be mounted when not in "stay" mode
- Tamed Auroral Nautili no longer require a saddle to ride
- Added charge boost mechanic when riding Auroral Nautili
  - Hold Space to charge up, release for a burst of speed
  - Charge takes 2 seconds to fully build
  - Boost strength scales with charge level (up to 3x speed)
- Shimmerweave Skates now have ice skating momentum mechanics
  - Gain and maintain momentum on ice like a boat
  - Very low friction allows coasting when not pressing movement keys
  - Blue ice has the lowest friction, followed by packed ice, then regular ice

## Balance Changes

- Shimmerweave armor now provides diamond-equivalent protection
  - Defense: 3/6/8/3 (boots/leggings/chestplate/helmet) - 20 total armor points
  - Toughness: 2.0 (same as diamond)
  - Durability: increased slightly to (20% less than diamond)

## Configuration

Added extensive server-side configuration options:

- **Shimmerweave Equipment**
  - `skates_ice_speed_boost` - Speed multiplier on regular ice (default: 1.05 = +105%)
  - `skates_packed_ice_speed_boost` - Speed multiplier on packed/blue ice (default: 2.1 = +210%)
  - `skates_frost_walker_radius` - Frost walker and lava walker radius (default: 2)
  - `leggings_snow_speed_boost` - Speed multiplier on snow (default: 0.2 = +20%)
  - `leggings_soul_speed_boost` - Speed multiplier on soul sand/soil (default: 0.3 = +30%)
  - `goggles_glowing_radius` - Radius for hostile mob detection (default: 32)

- **Auroral Nautilus**
  - `nautilus_boost_duration` - Charge boost duration in ticks (default: 10)
  - `nautilus_boost_strength` - Maximum boost multiplier at full charge (default: 3.0)
  - `nautilus_despawn_delay` - Ticks before wild nautili despawn after aurora ends (default: 600)

- **Aurora Self-Repair**
  - `aurora_repair_rate` - Durability repaired per second on Shimmersteel/Shimmerweave gear during aurora (default: 1)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed Shimmersteel Sword execute not triggering properly
  - Execute now triggers when a hit would bring the target to or below 15% HP
  - Now properly uses the configurable execute threshold from server config
- Fixed Shimmerweave Leggings speed boost not triggering consistently on snow layers
- Fixed Shimmerweave Skates speed boost not triggering consistently on snow layers
- Fixed invalid recipe link in Shimmerweave Skates guidebook page
- Removed debug footprint logging from console output
- Fixed player sitting too low when riding Auroral Nautili (now sits on top of shell)
- Fixed Auroral Nautilus charge boost not applying speed correctly
- Removed debug logging from Shimmerweave Skates and Nautilus systems
- Fixed Shimmer Soil not being hydrated by nearby Shimmering Ice
- Fixed Shimmersteel tools and Shimmerweave armor not self-repairing during aurora events
  - Items now repair while worn, held, or in hotbar during aurora
