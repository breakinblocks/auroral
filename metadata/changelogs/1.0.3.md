# Auroral 1.0.3

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed aurora sky ribbons not rendering at all
  - Turns out the network sync for aurora state wasn't actually registering properly, so clients never knew when an aurora was happening
  - Also fixed an issue with how vertex buffers were being created that would have caused rendering to fail anyway
- Fixed potential crash when aurora event starts in certain edge cases
